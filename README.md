## Design Patterns in C# - A collection of the Gang Of Four patterns (WIP)
The project is a group of class libraries that contain creational, behavioral and structural design patterns 

### Creational patterns 
	* Prototype
	* Singleton
	* Factory Method
	* Abstract Factory
	* Builder

### Structural patterns 
	* Adapter
	* Bridge
	* Composite
	* Decorator
	* Facade
	* Flyweight
	* Proxy

### Behavioural patterns

	* Strategy
	* Command
	* State
	* Mediator
	* Chain of Responsibility
	* Template Method
	* Visitor
	* Iterator
	* Observer
	* Memento



To get started, clone the repo, build the project, then run the console application named Program.EntryPoint. 
Here you'll find methods which you can uncomment to test out the pattern.

This solution requires `.NET 6` to run. Happy coding! :)
