## Design Patterns in C# - A collection of the Gang Of Four patterns (WIP)

## Problems are sourced from pluralsight

The project is a group of class libraries that contain creational, behavioral and structural design patterns 
### Creational patterns you will find include:

	* Prototype
	* Singleton
	* Factory Method
	* Abstract Factory
	* Builder

### Structural patterns you will find include:

	* Adapter
	* Bridge
	* Composite
	* Decorator
	* Facade
	* Flyweight
	* Proxy

### Behavioural patterns you will find include:

	* Strategy
	* Command
	* State
	* Mediator
	* Chain of Responsibility
	* Template Method
	* Visitor
	* Iterator
	* Observer
	* Memento



To get started, clone the repo, build the project, then run the console application named Program.EntryPoint. 
Here you'll find methods which you can uncomment to test out the pattern.

This solution requires `.NET 6` to run. Happy coding! :)
