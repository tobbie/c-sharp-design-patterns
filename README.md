## Design Patterns in C# - A collection of the Gang Of Four patterns

## Problems are sourced from pluralsight

The project is a group of class libraries that contain creational, behavioral and structural design patterns 
### Creational patterns you will find include:

	* Prototype
	* Singleton
	* Factory Method
	* Abstract Factory
	* Builder

### Structural patterns you will find include:

	* Adapter
	* Bridge
	* Composite
	* Decorator
	* Facade
	* Flyweight
	* Proxy

### Behavioural patterns you will find include:

	* Strategy
	* Command
	* State
	* Mediator
	* Chain of Responsibility
	* Template Method
	* Visitor
	* Iterator
	* Observer
	* Memento







In addition to the above, there's a class library project that contains common patterns to solve certain types of problems and another with popular
Microsoft interview questions.

To get started, clone the repo, build the project, then run `dotnet test` to see all tests run.

This solution requires `.NET 6` to run. Happy coding! :)
